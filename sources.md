# Machine Learning Sources 

We will follow portions of a variety of sources in this class, and so there is no required textbook. A non-exhaustive list of sources is here:
- Tom Mitchell, Machine Learning, McGraw Hill, 1997.
- Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig, Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 3rd ed., 2009. (primarily Chapter 18)
- [Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman, The Elements of Statistical Learning, 2nd ed., Springer, 2016.](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf)
- Satish Kumar,Neural Networks: A Classroom Approach, 2nd ed., 2013. (primarily Chapter 8)
