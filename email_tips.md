# ✉️ Email Tips 

You will likely need some individual help at some point in time during the semester, and this is a good thing! You are here to learn and I am here to help you. Here are a few tips to make our communication as efficient as possible this semester.

## 1. Who:
Let's start by the **who** to send it to. [Professor Urness -- timothy.urness@drake.edu](mailto:timothy.urness@drake.edu) . 
Please feel free to email me *any* questions (related to the course or otherwise). You'll get the most friendly response back if your email addresses me as "Professor Urness". Emails that begin with "Hey Urness," or just "Urness:" typically make it to the back of my priority list. 

## 2. What: 
A successful email to the professor, specifcially an email that is looking for help debugging some code should have a few components:
- **Descriptive Subject**: Start off with a Subject line that is descriptive. Include the Course Number (CS167) and the assignment that you are having trouble with.
- **Problem**: Include a concise description of the problem 
- **The Error**: What's gone wrong? Is there an error? If so, be sure to include the error. Make sure it's easy to understand where you got stuck.
- **Things you've tried**: Include a description of what you've tried to get past this problem so far.
- **Link to Your Updated Code**: This one is important. Be sure to push (save) your most recent code to GitHub, and include the link to your GitHub repository in your email. 

## 3. When:
While I will do my best to respond to your questions quickly and efficiently, the closer to the deadline that you ask the question, 
the less likely there will be time for me to answer your question before the deadline. Get started on your assignments early, and be sure to ask questions early and often.

# Examples:
